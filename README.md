C:\mingw-w64\x86_64-6.2.0-win32-sjlj-rt_v5-rev1\mingw64\bin\x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++.exe

9. Click Configure again to get rid of red entries in CMake-Gui and than click Generate

10. Go to C:\opencv\cygwin directory in cmd.exe and build it using mingw32-make

11. Use set(OpenCV_DIR "C:/opencv/cygwin") in CMakeLists.txt of current project

12. Important! project need to use /common/cmake/FindOpenCV.make
and set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/")
and include header files with include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
